##Fled

A program used to demonstrate finding the morse code letter that a blinking light is emitting

####Usage

fled <duration> <resolution x> <resolution y> <patch_height> <patch_width> <channel>

<duration>
	how long the camera will record the light
	
<resolution x>
	resizes the images to the number of pixels in the x direction
	setting this value to -1 will make the program use the original size
	
<resolution x>
	see <resolution y>
	
<patch_height>
	the height of the convolution kernel in pixels
	
<patch_width>
	the width of the convolution kernel in pixels
	
<channel>
	the channel to be analysed, can be one of
		- R for the red channel of the RGB colour space
		- G for the green channel of the RGB colour space
		- B for the blue channel of the RGB colour space
		- H for the hue channel of the HLS colour space
		- L for the light channel of the HLS colour space
		- S for the saturation channel of the HLS colour space
		- GREY for a greyscale version of the image
		
	if a value is input that is not included in the list above the program will default
	to a greyscale image.
